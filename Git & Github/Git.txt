                           GIT
Version Control System
It is a decentralizes version control tool
It is a tool which helps to manage our project's files. It tracks every changes in our file or code
It gives us history, it makes easy to collaborate with other people and it makes easy to work on other features at ones by using/creating feature branch.
 
Basic Commands
1. git init    --> Initialize Local git repository
2. git add <file/.>    --> Add file(s) to index
3. git status   ---> Check working status of the tree
4. git commit -m "message"  --> commit changes in index
5. git config --global user.name <parwezaamir1>          --> Helps to connect local with github/remote server
6. git remote add origin <provide here the github https repo link>   --> It helps to connect our local to remote repository
7. git push origin master  --> push to remote repository
8. git clone  -->  Copy the remote repository to our current folder
9. git pull   --> Pull latest changes from remote repository
10. git log   --> Provide all the history and changes
11. git difftool HEAD    ----> It shows difference between your local changes and previous version of file 
12. git rm --cached <file>  --> It helps to remove the added file to untracked
13. git add <*.html>    --> It adds all the .html file to the staging area
14. git branch <branch-name>  --> it is going to create new branch
15. git checkout <branch-name>   --> To switch between the branch
16. git merge <branch-name> -m "message"   --> To merge the code from branch-name into master branch 
17. git revert <commit-name or commit-id>   --->Use to revert the commit back to staging 

Interview:-
1. What is distributed version control system
  --- These are the system that don't rely on a central server to store a project file and all its version
  
2. Git and Github
  --- Git is a version control system of distributed nature that is used to track changes in the source code during software development. 
      Main objective of git are speed, data integrity, support for distributed non-linear workflows
  --- Github is a git repository hosting service plus adds many of its own features. Provides web based graphical interface, access control and several
      classical collaboration 
	  
3. How to fix a broken commit
   --- In order to fix any broken commit we can use the command  git commit --amend. After running this command we can fix the broken commit message 
       in the editor 
	   
4. Git Pull and Git fetch
   --- git pull pulls the new changes or commits from a particular branch from your remote repository and updates the target branch in our local repoitory.
   
   --- git fetch is use for the same purpose but it works in a slightly different way. It pulls all new commits from the desired branch 
       and stores it in a new branch in your local repository.
5. Git diff and git status
   --- git diff depicts the changes between commits, commit and working tree etc
   --- git status shows the differnce between the working directory and the index

6. Branching strategy(imp)

7. How to check whether branch has merged or not.
    ---- git branch --merged
8. revert and reset
